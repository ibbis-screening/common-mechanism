Module for a hidden markov model handler, specifically for calling hmmscan command line interface.
Additional methods for reading hmmscan output, readhmmer, which returns a pandas database.
Instantiate a HmmerHandler, with input local database, input fasta, and output file.
Throws if inputs are invalid. Creates a temporary log file, which is deleted on completion.
